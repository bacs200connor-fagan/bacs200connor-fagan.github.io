    <h1>Funny Stuff</h1>
    <p>Really funny page</p>
    <h2>Funny golf course</h2>
    <p>"There's a donkey on hole 6." This could go down as one of the funniest golf videos I've seen. I work in the golf industry and and only imagine how awesome it would be to remove a donkey from a golf course.</p>

    <h2>How much Kool-Aid is too much?</h2>
    <p>Bert Kreischer claims that he drinks about a gallon of Kool-Aid each day to enhance the taste of water. I find this clip to be hilarious when Tom Segura completely loses it when he realizes that Bert is dead serious.</p>

    <h2>Christmas time fun</h2>
    <p>When you were a kid, didn't you love playing outside around Christmas time in the snow? Well, the guys from Jackass do too and this clip exemplifies all the high adrenaline fun you can have with your friends this holiday season.</p>

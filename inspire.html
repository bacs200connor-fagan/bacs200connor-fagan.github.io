        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>Someone who makes a difference in the world, no matter how small. A hero should provide passion and inspiration, something for others to strive to be like.</p>
        <p>There is arguably no golfer who has ever done what Tiger Woods has, Tiger Woods is a hero for breaking racial barriers in golf and inspiring a generation of young golfers. He changed the way golf is played and continues to inspire people all over the world and is what people strive to be like from a golf perspective. Even though he has suffered injuries in the recent years and is not playing as much, his impact in the golf world is very similar to marks that Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan made in basketball, or what Ken Griffey Jr. or Derek Jeter did in baseball. </p>
